<p class="br">The aim of education is to acquire knowledge, not only of facts, but of valuesâ€¦. As we move towards
    becoming a developed nation, the role of youth of the country, becomes increasingly important. We wish to
    be a cutting-edge university, to anticipate the needs of the future and meet them here and to cre ate a physical
    environment that supports teaching, learning, and research.</p>
<p class="br">The Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University is making efforts to rise to the level of a world
    class institution to create new horizons in the arena of technical education and research. Curriculum
    innovation is addressed as the top most priority by the University to make the courses industry and research
    oriented. The young dedicated and qualified faculty members are waiting to receive and lead you towards an
    excellent academic career for your better tomorrow.</p>

<p class="br">We will be providing and constantly improving a research-friendly environment where excellent
    staff/researchers nationally, regionally and even internationally will work together. It is the people involved
    in this robust commitment to research who animate our university and make it the exciting place that it is.
    Blessed are those who get an opportunity to become students of higher education and more so are those who
    are paid for being student! Education is what remains after what has been learned is forgotten! It enables you
    to lead a fuller, richer, more varied and creative life. Make the best use of it for personal gains, social and
    national development. Thanks and all the best wishes!</p>
