        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;">Welcome to Badaun Institute of Management & Technology (BIMT).Today, we stand at a unique moment
            in time and we should understand these challenges that lie ahead of us. With management education at an
            inflection point, we must strive to equip leaders of tomorrow with the competence, ability and character to
            address emerging global business and social challenges.
            Cataclysmic changes, intense competition, uncertain business cycles and difficult geo-political terrain have
            made today’s business environment very dynamic and unpredictable. With Liberalization,</p>

        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;">Privatization and Globalization (LPG) move sweeping the west in post war years and Developing and
            Least Developing Countries (LDCs) following suit since late 1970s, World is getting more and more integrated
            and also globalized.</p>

        <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;">Against this philosophy, we at BIMT design our programme with the belief that today’s managers
            need to inculcate in themselves an analytical orientation to understand and analyze complex business
            situations while at the same time possess an action orientation and an administrative point of view. The
            Curriculum at BIMT is anchored to foster a much deeper intellectual exploration to meet the requirements of
            Trade and Industry and Society as well. Our training and programme are guided by our vision, mission and
            core values.
            I welcome you to navigate through our website to learn more about the Institute and its activities.
            All The Best</p>
